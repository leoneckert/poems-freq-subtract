 Rose, it roads
 marred both both ages a petals,
 could for thin,
 spare a looked

 more precious
 than And wet diverged
 Two in And stem --
 as one all the I less

 Stunted, both small looked
 as one be in I sand,
 as one wood,
 the I crisp sand
 looked drives the I wind.

 Can I spice-rose
 drip such took fragrance
 hardened the And just
